**Updated:** 04 Jan 2026 11:54

**Relics** in Nightreign are permanent progress for **Nightfarers** earned after every successful and unsuccessful run. Relics provide passive benefits once equipped in **Roundtable Hold**.

## Relic Colors and Slots
Each Relic has a specific color, and Nightfarers have 3 color-coded slots. You can **ONLY** slot Relics into matching colors:
* **Red:** Burning Scene
* **Green:** Tranquil Scene
* **Blue:** Drizzly Scene
* **Yellow:** Luminous Scene

## Relic Quality
Relics come in three tiers based on the number of passive bonuses they provide:
* **Delicate:** 1 passive bonus.
* **Polished:** 2 passive bonuses.
* **Grand:** 3 passive bonuses.

## Key Rules for Randomized Relics
To prevent overpowered stacking, certain rules apply to the effects generated on a single Relic:

* **No Duplicate Ability Types:** You cannot have "Vigor +1" and "Vigor +2" on the same relic.
* **No Overlapping Weapon Classes:** You cannot have "Improved Greatsword" and "Improved Colossal Sword" on the same relic.
* **One Character-Exclusive Limit:** A relic cannot hold more than one character-specific ability.
* **One Infusion/Skill Limit:** Only one ability that modifies the starting weapon's infusion or skill is allowed.
* **Attack Power Limit:** A relic cannot hold more than one "Attack Power Up" ability (this includes Guard Counters, Initial Attacks, or Fire/Magic/Physical damage buffs).
* **Spell Type Limit:** Only one "Improved Sorcery/Incantation" type per relic (e.g., cannot have both Carian and Godslayer boosts).

## Management & Compatibility
* **Relic Rites Menu:** Found in the central room of the **Roundtable Hold**.
* **Compatibility:** If an effect doesn't match your character or gear, it will be dimmed out.
* **Conflicts:** If two equipped relics clash (e.g., two different infusions), a **red exclamation mark** appears. The left-most relic takes priority.
* **Selling:** Unwanted random relics can be sold in the Relic Rite menu. **Note:** Remembrance and Night Lord relics cannot be sold.
