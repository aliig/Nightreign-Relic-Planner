Relic Stacking Mechanics in Elden Ring: Nightreign

Nightreign’s relic system introduces many permanent, repeatable buffs. These buffs generally combine multiplicatively – i.e. one bonus multiplies against another – rather than simply adding. In practice this means two separate attack buffs of, say, +21% and +30% will result in an overall factor of 1.21×1.30 (≈1.573×), not 1.51×. As community testers note, “every buff is multiplicative in this game”. (Put another way: equipping multiple generic %‐buff relics yields compounding multipliers.)

Stacking vs. Non-Stacking Effects

In Nightreign, generic stat and damage buffs stack, whereas unique or trigger‐based effects do not. A useful community summary is: “Unique ones don’t stack, generic ones do”. In practice, this yields two broad categories:

Stacking effects (generic buffs): Generic stat increases and damage multipliers from relics stack multiplicatively. For example, all flat percentage increases to attack power stack – this includes “X Element attack power up” relics, generic physical/melee attack buffs, stance damage increases, and “Improved Skill Attack Power” buffs. Pure stat boosts (e.g. +Strength, +Dexterity) also stack. Other stacking effects include stamina regeneration on hit, poise bonuses, improved damage negation at low HP, school-specific magic/incantation boosts, and reduced skill cooldown. In short, any flat or percentage increase to your character’s stats or damage (without a situational trigger) will combine fully with another.

Non-Stacking effects (unique/triggers): By contrast, triggered or highly specific effects generally do not stack. This includes all health‑restoration triggers, such as “HP on Thrusting counterattacks,” “partial HP restored on post-damage attacks,” “HP Regen on low health,” and “HP recovery on guard” – none of these stack with themselves. Similarly, any character- or weapon-specific bonus (e.g. “starting weapon has X Ash of War” or “character skill upgrades”) won’t stack beyond what one relic provides. Situational damage boosts tied to enemy status also do not stack: for instance, relics that increase attack power when near poison or rot, or that break stance more effectively, are explicitly non-stackable. (The community call-outs list many such non-stacking cases, all of which boil down to: if an effect only sometimes applies or is unique, you won’t get two of them doubling up.)

In summary: flat/percent buffs to core stats or damage stack; conditional heals, special triggers, and unique/artifact effects do not. For example, multiple “+% Strength” or “+% magic damage” relics multiply together, but two “restore HP on guard” relics will not.

Unique Relics, Overrides, and Conflicts

Many relics are one-of-a-kind or bound to a specific character/ability. Such unique relics won’t double up if you equip more than one copy. For instance, the DLC’s signature relic “Will of the Balancers” is meant to be unique, so patch notes explicitly state that if you obtain and equip more than one copy, only one will actually activate. In general, any unique or story-critical relic follows this rule (only its strongest instance counts).

 

Beyond that, Nightreign uses hidden “categories” to prevent incompatible effects from coexisting on the same relic. You simply cannot have two effects from the same hidden category on a single relic. In the UI, incompatible effects are sometimes flagged with a caution icon. (For example, relics that enhance character skills often carry a red-border icon indicating exclusivity.) However, players have found some quirks: one tester noted that Ironeye’s and Wylder’s “+1 skill uses” relics did not stack (even though the UI gave no caution). Similarly, stacking two Duchess character-skill damage relics showed no benefit in testing (though another user later claimed they did stack – the community still has mixed reports on some of these). The safe rule is that if an effect is marked unique or character/skill-specific, it likely overrides rather than stacks.

Deep Relic Upgrades & Tier Interactions

Nightreign introduced deep relics with tiers (base, +1, +2, etc.) that further complicate stacking. Broadly, higher-tier versions of a relic multiply with each other, but usually do not stack with the base version. For example, the “Partial HP Restoration on Post-Damage Attacks” relic has +1 and +2 tiers. Community testing showed that +1 and +2 versions do stack together, but neither stacks with the base (+0) version. In practice, this means if you want maximum effect, equip only the higher tiers.

 

There are some intriguing exceptions: one player found that a relic effect for “Defeating enemies for Ultimate Art charge” stacks between the +0 and +1 versions, meaning both copies can contribute. Even more, status-vulnerability damage buffs (e.g. “Attack Power up vs enemies afflicted by X status”) were reported to stack across all three tiers (+0, +1, +2), giving a large cumulative bonus. And simple percentage bonuses stack normally: for instance, multiple identical physical/element relic buffs (like “+4% Physical Attack Power”) do stack multiplicatively.

 

In summary, deep relics can often be stacked tier‐by‐tier: +1 with +2 will multiply, base with +1 usually won’t (but there are exceptions, especially with kill-count or status effects). Players have even found humorous synergies from this: e.g. combining a base relic with a +1 relic that have similar effects can sometimes be “hilarious” in damage output.

Exceptions, Bugs, and Balancing Changes

Some odd cases and fixes have emerged post-launch. For example, various patches have adjusted relic effects but not their stacking rules. One patch fixed a bug where “stacks” from kill-count relics would reset if you died – now accumulated stacks persist properly through death. Another (hotfix 1.03.2) rebalanced certain relic bonuses (e.g. toning down bow attack buffs) but didn’t change stacking behavior.

 

An important exploit was corrected in patch 1.03.2: previously players could obtain a glitchy second copy of “Will of the Balancers,” allowing triple stacks of its effect. The patch note clarifies that although multiple copies could be acquired, only one activates. (Players noted that double-stacking remained possible only by using a different-named variant, but triple-stacking was eliminated.) Aside from this, most “synergies” come from intended multiplicative stacking. For example, stacking multiple elemental/stance buffs leads to very high damage (the so-called “multiplier meta” praised by players).

<GEMINI VERSION>
Mathematical Foundations of Attribute StackingA substantial portion of the Relic pool is dedicated to direct attribute increases, such as Vigor +X, Strength +X, or Dexterity +X. These follow a linear additive logic within the hidden stat layer of the game. If a player equips a Strength +3 Relic and a Strength +1 Relic, the character functionally gains +4 Strength. However, the relevance of these additive stacks is complicated by the distinction between "Character Levels" and "Attribute Levels".Hidden Level Scaling and the Level 12 Soft-CapCommunity datamining and system analysis suggest that attributes in Nightreign operate on a 1-99 scale, separate from the 1-15 expedition level cap. When a player levels up during a run, their attributes increase based on the character’s native scaling (graded E through S). Relic bonuses are added to these base values. A critical discovery is that the most significant power spike occurs between Level 1 and Level 2, while levels 13 through 15 provide dramatically reduced attribute gains, imposing a "soft-cap" around Level 12.The implication for Relic stacking is that flat attribute bonuses provide significant "early tempo" but lose efficacy as the expedition progresses. A +3 Strength bonus may represent a 12% damage increase at Level 1, but by Level 15, that same +3 bonus may only contribute 2-3% of the character’s total damage output. In contrast, percentage-based damage buffs remain consistent throughout the run, making them the preferred choice for late-game optimization.AttributeEffect of StackingSoft-Cap ThresholdScaling LogicVigorAdds ~20 HP per point 40 / 60Accelerating returns until 40 MindAdds FP to total pool50 / 60Linear FP increase per pointEnduranceAdds Stamina and Equip Load15 / 30 / 50Diminishing returns on Stamina StrengthIncreases physical damage18 / 50 / 60 / 80Scaling dependent on weapon classDexterityIncreases physical damage18 / 50 / 60 / 80Affects casting speed and secondary statsIntelligenceIncreases magic scaling20 / 50 / 80Affects spell and weapon damageFaithIncreases incantation scaling20 / 50 / 80Affects holy/fire weapon damageCategorical Multipliers: Damage and Elemental StackingRelics that provide categorical buffs (e.g., "Fire Attack Power Up," "Improved Critical Boost," "Physical Attack Up") generally utilize multiplicative stacking logic. While two instances of the exact same Relic effect (defined by the same internal ID) will not stack, different Relics that provide the same type of bonus—such as a generic "Physical Attack Up" and a specific "Bow Attack Power Up"—will multiply their effects.The mathematical model for final damage ($D_{f}$) in a scenario with multiple multiplicative Relic stacks is:$$D_{f} = D_{base} \times \prod_{i=1}^{n} (1 + M_{i})$$Where $M_{i}$ represents the percentage bonus of each unique Relic. This multiplicative nature makes the "Double Balancer" build—utilizing two Balancer relics—exceptionally potent, resulting in a compound damage buff of approximately 48% to 58% depending on the specific interactions with other secondary buffs.Conflict and Graying-Out MechanicsThe game provides visual feedback when effects do not stack. If two Relics with mutually exclusive properties are equipped, one may be "grayed out" or marked with a red alert symbol. For instance, a player cannot stack two different "Starting Armament Affinity" Relics; you cannot have a starting weapon that simultaneously deals Holy and Fire damage. The system forces the player to choose one, highlighting the developer's intent to limit "jack-of-all-trades" builds in favor of specialized roles.Stacking of Tiered Suffixes (+0, +1, +2)A nuanced component of the Nightreign meta is the interaction between Relics with tiered suffixes. These tiers are not just numerical upgrades; they interact through a "compound multiplier" rule.In the case of "Post-Damage HP Restoration," the tiers function as follows:Tier +0: Acts as the mechanical baseline (1.0 multiplier). It enables the effect but provides no additional bonus.Tier +1: Provides a 1.25 multiplier to the base healing amount.Tier +2: Provides a 1.35 multiplier to the base healing amount.If a player equips a +0 and a +1 Relic, they do not stack because $1.0 \times 1.25 = 1.25$. However, if they equip a +1 and a +2 Relic, the multipliers compound: $1.25 \times 1.35 = 1.6875$, resulting in a 68.75% increase in healing over the base effect. This logic applies to several other tiered systems, including the "Defeating Enemies Fills Art Gauge" effect, where stacking a +1 (5% gain) and a +2 (6.5% gain) results in an 11.83% total gain per kill.The Inventory Condition: The "3+" Stacking RuleThe "Improved Attack Power with 3+ Equipped" Relics introduce a stacking logic tied to the player’s inventory state rather than a purely passive stat. These Relics provide a flat 10% damage increase to all actions (weapon hits, spells, items) as long as three weapons of the specified class are present in the player’s active slots or inventory.Inventory Management and Condition CheckingThis 10% bonus is a binary "True/False" check. Consequently, equipping two of the same "3+ Bows" Relics will not yield a 20% bonus; once the condition of having three bows is met, the system recognizes the buff as active, and the second Relic is redundant. However, this effect does stack with other damage-increasing Relics that do not share the "3+ weapon" condition.Interestingly, even low-quality weapons can trigger this condition. A player carrying three "white" (common) staffs will receive the 10% global damage buff, which can be more effective than carrying a single "purple" (rare) staff without the corresponding Relic trigger. This forces players to make tactical decisions regarding inventory space and weapon diversity during a run.Character-Specific Stacking ConstraintsRelics categorized as [Character] specific—often acquired through Remembrance quests or from defeating specific Nightlords—follow a much more restrictive set of stacking rules. The general rule is that these effects do not stack with themselves.The Remembrance ConflictIf a player equips two instances of Wylder’s "Extra Claw Shot Use" Relic, they will only receive one additional charge (totaling two), rather than three. Similarly, character-specific skill buffs, such as Duchess's "Improved Character Skill Attack Power," have been tested to show no cumulative damage increase when multiple instances are equipped. This prevents players from creating "broken" character loops solely through duplicate high-tier Remembrance Relics.CharacterSpecific Relic EffectStacking StatusImplicationsWylder+1 Claw ShotDoes NOT stack Limits max utility to 2 chargesGuardianDamage Reflect on GuardDoes NOT stack Focuses on poise damage insteadDuchessSkill Attack PowerDoes NOT stack Prevents infinite skill-scalingIroneyeMarking Duration Ext.Unique, No stackBinary duration increaseRaiderTotem Poise AuraUnique, No stackFixed aura benefitRevenantFamily Power BoostUnique, No stackStatic multiplier based on alliesHowever, character-specific Relics can stack with generic Relics that address the same stat or mechanic. For instance, a Duchess Remembrance Relic that improves character skill damage will stack with a generic "Physical Attack Up" Relic, as they are separate categories of buffs.Defensive Calculus: Multiplicative Negation and the HP/Negation DebateDamage Negation Relics (e.g., Physical Damage Negation, Elemental Negation) follow a multiplicative diminishing returns formula. This ensures that even with perfect Relic rolls, a player can never reach 100% damage immunity.The formula for damage taken with multiple negation sources is:$$Damage_{taken} = Damage_{initial} \times \prod_{i=1}^{n} (1 - Negation_{i})$$For example, if a player has 20% base physical defense and equips a Relic that adds 18% physical negation, they do not have 38% defense. Instead, they take 80% damage from the first layer, and that 80% is reduced by 18%, resulting in 65.6% damage taken (or 34.4% total defense).Max HP vs. Specific NegationBecause negation is multiplicative and specific to damage types (e.g., piercing, holy, fire), many high-level players prioritize "Max HP Up" Relics over specific negation Relics. Stacking HP is more effective for three reasons:Universality: HP provides a buffer against all damage types simultaneously.Flask Scaling: Healing flasks in Nightreign scale as a percentage of total health. Stacking three "HP Up" Relics increases the healing value of every flask consumed during a run.Survival Thresholds: At high depths, "getting one-shot" is the primary cause of failure. High HP is often the only way to survive the high-alpha strikes of Nightlords like Heolstor.Cooperative Stacking: The Rune Acquisition Meta
