# Relic Effects | Nightreign Wiki Elden Ring

**Updated:** 12 Jan 2026 23:52

**Relic Effects** in Nightreign are bonuses granted by Relics that offer players various offensive and defensive advantages in combat. Each Relic Effect is randomized when obtaining a Relic, which means players could obtain a Relic with an effect that is character-specific, provide permanent buffs, buffs that help with critical damage, damage negation, stamina regeneration, and so on.

### Relic Rarities
* **Delicate:** Provides 1 Relic Effect.
* **Polished:** Provides 2 Relic Effects.
* **Grand:** Provides 3 Relic Bonuses.

There are also unique Relics that are specific to characters and can only be equipped by them.

### How to Obtain Relics
Players can obtain Relics upon completing an expedition (successful or not), by purchasing them at the **Small Jar Bazaar** with Murk, and by completing Nightfarer objectives. Each Nightfarer has a specific color set of Relics they may have equipped depending on the **Vessels** they have.
