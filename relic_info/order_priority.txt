In Elden Ring: Nightreign, the "Left-to-Right" priority system (Slot 1 > Slot 2 > Slot 3) is a critical mechanic for high-level build optimization. While most stat-based properties stack regardless of position, any property that fundamentally changes an aspect of your character or weapon will be subject to the priority rule.

Here is the comprehensive list of relic property types impacted by their order in your Vessel:

1. Starting Armament Affinities (Status/Elemental)
This is the most frequent conflict. If you equip multiple relics that add a "starting affinity" to your default weapon, only the leftmost relic's effect is applied.

Impacted Properties: "Starting armament deals Poison/Rot/Frost/Bleed damage," or "Starting armament is infused with Magic/Holy/Fire/Lightning."

The Result: If Slot 1 is Poison and Slot 2 is Fire, your weapon will only deal Poison damage. The Fire property is effectively "muted."

2. Starting Weapon Skills (Ashes of War)
Some relics grant your starting weapon a specific Ash of War (like Quickstep, Seppuku, or Golden Vow). Since a weapon can only have one active skill:

Impacted Properties: Any relic that states "Changes starting armament skill to [X]."

The Result: The skill from the leftmost relic overrides all others. This is why players often hunt for "Flipped Vessels" (e.g., switching a Red-Yellow-Blue order to Blue-Yellow-Red) to ensure their preferred skill is in the priority slot.

3. Ultimate Art & Character Skill "Morphs"
Nightreign features character-specific relics that don't just buff a skill, but transform it. If these transformations are mutually exclusive (changing the fundamental behavior or element), order determines the outcome.

Impacted Properties: "Ultimate Art now creates a [Element] explosion," or "Character Skill now leaves a [Status] trail."

The Result: If you have one relic morphing Wylder's Claw Shot into a Fire-tether and another morphing it into a Magic-tether, only the Slot 1 version will activate.

4. Non-Stacking Aura Effects
Certain high-tier relics provide a constant aura to your character or teammates. Many of these are coded to not stack with themselves or similar effects to prevent "buff-looping."

Impacted Properties: "Provides an aura that increases Poise/Defense for nearby allies."

The Result: If two relics provide the same type of aura, the potency and priority are dictated by the leftmost slot (usually the one with the higher value +1/+2/+3, though Slot 1 is the safety net).

What is NOT Impacted? (Stacking Properties)
You do not need to worry about the order for the following, as they simply add together:

Base Stat Increases: +5 Vigor, +3 Strength, etc.

Percentage Buffs: +10% Attack Power, +15% Stamina Recovery.

Gauge Reductions: Ultimate Arts Gauge +1 and Character Skill Cooldown −1. These are additive and work regardless of placement.

Rune/Drop Rates: Increased Rune acquisition or Item Discovery.

Pro Tip: If you find a "God Roll" relic that has incredible stats but a Starting Skill you hate, place it in Slot 2 or 3. Then, put a relic with a Skill you actually like in Slot 1. Slot 1 will overwrite the "bad" skill, but you’ll still get all the passive stat boosts from the other slots.
